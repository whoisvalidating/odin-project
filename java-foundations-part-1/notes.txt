Fundamentals part 1
1. how do you declare a variable/what is it?
with let, const, and var. this is declared in the <script> or javaScript file
its a storage container for data, like a box with a label 

2. What are three different ways to declare a variable?
let nameOfVariable = "";
const nameOfVariable = "";
var name of variable = "";

3. which one should you use when?
let = in general when a value may change
const = value can never change, but this is the standard you should shoot for.
var = old style. in general dont do this

4. What are the rules for naming variables?
can only contain....
letters, digits, $, - and _ (not commas)
in addition the first value can not be a number

5. What are operators, operands, and operations?
these are used for math calculations 
operators - are the type of math. + add - subtract * multiply / divide ** exponentiation % remainder ++ increment -- decrement
operands - are the values to be used in the math equation 
operations - the act of using an operand on a operator

6. what is concatenation, and what happens when you add a sting and a number?
concatenation is combining numbers or a number and a string.
5 + 5 = 10
5 + "five" = 5five
the second example is the number 5 and the string five. it would just add them together

7. what are the different types of operators? 
+ add - subtract * multiply / divide ** exponentiation % remainder ++ increment -- decrement

8. what is the difference between == and ===
== loose equality - compares regardless of type
=== strict equality comparison, compares the type of value not the value

9. what are operator precedence values?
order math is calculated in a equation
()
++ --
exponents**
* / %
+ -

10.what are the increment/decrement operators?
increase and decrease a value by one

11. what is the difference between prefixing and postfixing them?
prefixing - does addition/subtraction first and then returns the value ++let
postfixing - does addition/subtraction after returning the value let++

12. what are assignment operators?
used to assign values to variables... its a = sign

13. what is the unary plus operator?
it changes a value from a string into a number. and example would be
const fakeNumber = "10";
const realNumber = +fakeNumber;
this would convert fakeNumber into a digit and save it into realNumber

Fundamentals part 2
1. Name the eight data types in JavaScript.
string, number, bigInt, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, object

2. Understand the difference between single, double, and backtick quotes.
'single' and "double" are basically the same
a `backtick` is a template lateral, it allows you to embed expressions

3. Embed a variable/expression in a string.
this is achieved with backticks, an example would be
let variable = "expression"
stringEmbed = `this is a example of one ${variable}`;

4. Understand what a method is.
a method is what is a function that is associated with an object.

5. Name the three logical operators.
||  or  && and  ! not

6. Understand what the comparison operators are.
comparison operators are used to compare 2 values and return a Boolean (true/false)
== equal to
!= not equal to
=== strictly equal to
!== strictly not equal to
< less than
<= less than equal to
> greater than
>= greater than equal to

7. Understand what conditionals are.
how a function makes decisions based on values and conditions 
if, else, else if are the 3 ways to type a conditional

8. Understand what nesting is.
    embedding one structure within another

9. Understand what truthy and falsy values are.
truthy values are numbers, strings, boolean true, objects, null, and undefined. these will all be true
falsy values are the number 0, an empty string, and the boolean false
