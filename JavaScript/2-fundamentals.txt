Name the eight data types in JavaScript.
Number - represents both integer and floating point numbers. includes Infinity and NaN
BigInt - any value more than 2 to the 53rd power -1 (9007199254740990) or less than the same but negative if the same equation. signified by adding the letter n on the end of a number
string - text surrounded by quotes, can be ' " ` but must match 
boolean - store of yes(true) and no (false)
null - represents nothing
undefined - value not defined 
objects and symbols - other types are primitive (can only contain 1 thing), objects store multiple. the symbol is used to make a unique identifier


Understand the difference between single, double, and backtick quotes.
single and double are basically the same
a backtick has extended functionality and can embed variables and expressions by wapping ${thingYouAreLinking}


Embed a variable/expression in a string.
let name = "Abk";
let hello = `hello ${name}`;

Understand what a method is.
method is a bit of functionality built into the language or psecific data type

Name the three logical operators.


Understand what the comparison operators are.
> < greater than less than
>= <= greater than equal to less than equal to
== equals to (or === strict equality)
!= not equal to


Understand what conditionals are.


Understand what nesting is.


Understand what truthy and falsy values are.
