How do you declare a variable?
use the word let, and example would be

let message;

What are three different ways to declare a variable?
var - is the older way to declare a variable, not recommended now
let - this is the modern way to declare a variable - can be changed later
const - this is a constant or unchanging value - often named with all caps if hard coded

Which one should you use when?
"let" when you want the value to change, "const" when the value will never change

What are the rules for naming variables?
only contain letters, digits, and the symbols $ and _
first character must not be a digit
is case sensitive
can not use a reserved names   let, class, return, function

What are operators, operands, and operations?
operators - perform arithmetic on numbers (literals or variables)
operands - are the numbers in a arithmetic operation
operations - the act of using both of these

What is concatenation and what happens when you add numbers and strings together?

-- decrement

=== is not equal
What is the difference betw
What are assignment operators?
+= addition assignment - adds the value on the right to the left and returns a new variable value
-= subtraction assignment - left to right subtraction 
*= multiplication assignment - left to right subtraction
/= division assignment = left to right division

What is the Unary Plus Operator?
+stringIWantToBeANumber

var - it causes issues with modern code.

What rules should you follow when naming variables?

What happens when you add numbers and strings together?
string concatenation
